# Flare

## Project Description

A social-media sharing and combination app that allows professionals and businesses to share their profiles, resumes, and portfolios to others with a single QR read.

Using social media APIs. a user will be able to link their profiles to their account. Once another user scans their unique Flare QR Code, they will automatically be added to each other's connections. Once connected, a user can immediately follow any set of profiles associated with another user they're connected to. 

Users may also add files for viewing to their Flare account, such as images or PDFs, to reflect their expereiences and work (such as resumes, work examples, etc.)

User can also add unique website links to their Flare account, allowing easy portfolio sharing alongside allowing users to add any profiles not officially supported by Flare yet.
